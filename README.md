# React Mini Project: usePopcorn

This mini project is a React application called "usePopcorn" that allows users to explore and search for their favorite movies. The application uses React hooks (states and effects), and API integration.

## Project Description

The "usePopcorn" project comes with the following functionalities:

1. **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies and TV shows by entering their query into the search bar. The application will fetch and display relevant results using the OMDB API.

2. **Movie List:** The search results are presented as a list of movies and TV shows. Each item in the list includes the movie's title, image, and release year.

3. **Movie Details:** When a user clicks on a movie from the list, a detailed view of the movie is shown. This view contains additional information such as the movie's runtime, IMDb rating, plot summary, and cast.

4. **Add to Watched List:** Users can add movies to their watched list by selecting the movie and rating it using a star rating component.

5. **Watched Summary:** The application provides a summary of the movies watched by the user, including the total number of movies watched, average IMDb rating, average user rating, and average runtime.

6. **Delete from Watched List:** Users can remove movies from their watched list by clicking the delete button on the movie's entry.
